## Wood Re-balance
Crafting 4 logs into the 6-sided Wood now yields 4 Wood, rather than the 3 from the vanilla recipe. This applies to all 6 (with 1.16, 8) Wood variants and their stripped versions.

## Bulk Chest Crafting
You can more easily craft large amounts of chests by using logs in place of planks to give 4 chests. This works with all 6 (with 1.16, 8) wood variants, in all 4 forms (log, wood, stripped log, stripped wood) in any combination.

## Notch Apple Duplication
The Enchanted Golden Apple can now be crafted again (removed in 1.9), using a slightly modified recipe. Combining 7 Gold Blocks, a Golden Apple, and an Enchanted Golden Apple will yield 2 Enchanted Golden Apples.

This recipe is technically cheaper than the original recipe (by 1 ingot) but requires an existing Enchanted Apple to "seed" the craft, which will need to be found through normal loot.
