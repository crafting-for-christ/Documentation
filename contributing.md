# Contributing

> You can submit Pull Requests to the zander project here: https://github.com/benrobson/zander/pulls

We love teamwork and when people work together often other people learn new things.

We are totally up for people to make Pull Requests on our development projects and give us ideas in the issue tracker and if we've done something wrong or if there is something that we could do better we would love to hear everyone's suggestions on how we can be better.

We'd love anyone and everyone who knows the languages and the APIs that are used in this project and to encourage you to fork and create a Pull Request to either change something that we've done wrong all to add something and to generally contribute to the project.

This isn't just our project, we want this to be a software and a platform that anyone can easily use and jump start a Minecraft Server and get it to instantly run although, it may take a little bit of tweaking but you know..
