# Protective Piglins

Zombie Pigmen (and with 1.16, Piglins and Zombified Piglins) will randomly become aggressive to the player if you mine and pick up quartz. Using Silk Touch to collect the ore block will prevent this.

When you pick up a piece of quartz, there is a roughly 1 in 10 chance that the nearest Pigman within 32 blocks of you will become aggressive.

Finally, Skeleton Horses now have a chance to drop End Crystals on death. There is a 25% chance to drop 1 crystal, or up to 4 crystals with the Looting III enchantment.
