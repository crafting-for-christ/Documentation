# End Crystal Changes

**Multiple changes have been made regarding obtaining end crystals.**
**The vanilla crafting recipe for End Crystals has been removed!**

The primary way to obtain end crystals is now from end city loot, which will now randomly spawn crystals in the chests found throughout the cities and ships. There should be 1 crystal in each city on average.

The Dragon Egg can now be crafted directly into 2 end crystals. The Dragon's loot table has also been changed to drop a Dragon Egg on death, which together means you can extend your supply of end crystals to only require 2 crystals to respawn the Dragon, requiring 4 to start the process. It also means the Dragon Egg is a viable decorative block, rather than being the one-of-a-kind trophy.

Finally, Skeleton Horses now have a chance to drop End Crystals on death. There is a 25% chance to drop 1 crystal, or up to 4 crystals with the Looting III enchantment.
