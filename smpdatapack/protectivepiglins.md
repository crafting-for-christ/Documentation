# Protective Piglins

Zombie Piglin (and Zombified Piglins) will randomly become aggressive to the player if you mine and pick up quartz. Using Silk Touch to collect the ore block will prevent this.
When you pick up a piece of quartz, there is a roughly 1 in 10 chance that the nearest Piglin within 32 blocks of you will become aggressive.

You can find a demonstration video [here](lol)
