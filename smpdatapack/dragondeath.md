# Dragon Death

When the Ender Dragon is killed, a title will show on screen for all online players that the dragon has been killed, and who the player was who dealt the final blow.

The Dragon's loot table has also been modified to drop a Dragon Egg on death, in addition to the egg that generates on the End Portal on the death of the first dragon.
